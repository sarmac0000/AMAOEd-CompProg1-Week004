C++ Programming Language | VS Code
This repository contains a development environment for Visual Studio code to be used by C++ Programming Language of AMA Online Education.

Requirements
Download and install Visual Studio Code integrated development environment.

I am using MacOs, so we need the XCode extension (clang). To check if g++ is already installed run below command in using the terminal:

  g++ --version
If XCode extension is not yet installed, it will automatically initiate the install for clang.

Recommended Extensions
The following are recommended extensions for VS Code ( Mac: ⌘P ):

EditorConfig for VS Code by EditorConfig:

 ext install EditorConfig.editorconfig
C/C++ by Microsoft:

 ext install ms-vscode.cpptools
Install the g++ compiler
Install clang or g++ by installing the xcode command line tool. To check if already installed, run below command.

  g++ --version
If not yet installed, in my case it automatically download and install the xcode command line tool. I am using Macos Sierra.

After install run the g++ --version again
